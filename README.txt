How to run this program (assuming command line):
Method 1: Run the program and add an argument at the end indicating the mesh size.
Method 2: Run the program with no arguments, and when the program prompts for a mesh size, give one and press enter.

Output:

The program will output the values obtained at each point by the QR method and by Gaussian Elimination, and then the true values for each point. The points will be in the same order each time.

The program will then output the difference between the approximated and actual values for the QR method and Gaussian Elimination.

Finally, it will output the relative error for both methods.
